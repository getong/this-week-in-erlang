Hello and welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! This week your humble editor is
*Mark Allen* ([@bytemeorg][1]).

### Community Announcement
*Mariano Guerra* released the first ever "State of BEAM" survey last week, I wanted
to remind you (a final time) to fill it if you have forgotten. Please share
this survey with your network.

### Articles and Blog posts

- *Fred Hebert* wrote a whole website devoted to property based testing. In this style of
  testing, you do not write unit tests. Instead you write an invariant set of 
  properties about your code and the testing framework will generate inputs to see
  if your property/invariant holds.  This website focuses on the [PropEr][2] project
  style of syntax.

  Read more here: <http://propertesting.com>

- Quite a vigorous discussion this week on the [erlang-questions][6] mailing list
  about [reimplementing the BEAM VM in Rust][7] language.

- *Julia Evans* ([@b0rk][8]) wrote an interesting blog post last year about
  investigating Erlang by reading its system calls.

### Library updates

- Django style template library [erlyDTL][3] is looking for a new library
  maintainer. Maybe it's you?

- exometer\_core 1.5.0 was released and moved meck to its test profile. One
  less way to be infected with meck hell.

### OTP Updates
[OTP 20.0.5][5] was released this week.  Did you know you can use [kerl][4] to
build minor patch releases like this? You can! Set the shell variable
`KERL_BUILD_BACKEND=git` to enable using git tags for builds.  

### Library of the week
- This week's library is a NIF for Google's [snappy][9] compression library.
  Snappy provides compression that's about 20% larger than zlib at about 100x
  the speed.

  You can also use the [snzip][10] project if you need a command line tool to
  (de)compress Snappy archives. (On a Mac w/ homebrew try: `brew install snzip`)
