Hello and welcome to another “This week in Erlang” newsletter! This week your humble editor is
*Mark Allen* ([@bytemeorg][1]). I get to do a bonus release because of unexpected travel plan
changes.

The first ever [Indian Erlang and Elixir Factory Lite][8] will happen in
Bangalore, November 17, 2017. If you're in the vicinity, please join us!

### Articles and Blog posts

- *Brujo Benavides* wrote [a lovely retrospective look at Inaka][6], titled _The Best Company
  I ever worked for_.

- If you hadn't heard, Bet365 is acquiring Basho's intellectual property and [plans to 
  open source][3] all of it. There is a [two day workshop][2] in the UK where many
  of the interested parties can discuss the future of the code and the product.

- *Mariano Guerra* wrote part 2 of a post [discussing Multi-Paxos][4] in the context of 
  riak\_ensemble. (Catch up if you missed [Part 1][5].)

- Aspiring BEAM wizards will appreciate the [Understanding BEAM opcodes][7] site.

- I learned something new about how pattern matching works in function heads this week
  when I asked a question about pattern matching using maps on Stack Overflow. 

  *Richard Carlsson* had the best answer.

### OTP Updates
I noticed this README show up in my twitter feed this week. It's about the
asynchronous (non-blocking) code loading features of OTP since R16.

### Library of the week
Guilherme Andrade announced a new RPC-over-HTTP framework for Erlang. It does
not rely on Erlang's own distribution protocol.
