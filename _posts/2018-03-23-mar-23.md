Welcome to another long over-due “This week in Erlang” newsletter. 
We will keep it short this week and slowly build on the momentom :D I had the pleasure of attending CodeBEAM SF and meeting everyone. If you couldn't attend, CodeSync is planning many more gatherings so be sure to check out their website.

### Announcements

### Articles and Blog posts

- *A. Jesse Jiryu Davis* ([@jessejiryudavis](https://twitter/jessejiryudavis)): A really good article about how more experienced developers sometimes (unwittingly) shutdown and turn away less experienced developers was published last week at [opensource.com](opensource.com).
